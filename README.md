# CasaXPStoPy_PlottingTool
Publishable XPS plots without the suffering (kinda)

I don't plan on updating this tool anymore myself, but if it's found to be of use perhaps somone else can pick it up.

To add the .exe version requires installing "Github LFS", so I haven't done this, sorry. Email me for it if you don't want to install python.
